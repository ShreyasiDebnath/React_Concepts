`useNavigate` is a hook provided by React Router v6 and later that allows you to programmatically navigate users to different routes within your application. It provides a way to perform navigation without relying on traditional `<Link>` components or navigating directly via URL.

### Key Features of `useNavigate`

- **Programmatic Navigation**: Allows you to navigate to different routes based on user actions or other conditions.
- **Declarative API**: Simplifies the navigation process with a clear API.

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use `useNavigate` in a functional component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Navigate to the "/dashboard" route
    navigate('/dashboard');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Dashboard</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Example with Navigation State

You can also pass state to the navigation, which can be accessed by the target route:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Navigate to "/profile" and pass state
    navigate('/profile', { state: { fromDashboard: true } });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Profile</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In the target component (e.g., the `/profile` route), you can access the passed state using the `useLocation` hook:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function Profile() {
  const location = useLocation();
  const { fromDashboard } = location.state || {};

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Profile Page</h1>
      {fromDashboard && <p>Navigation was triggered from the dashboard.</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Profile;
```

### Example with Relative Navigation

You can use relative paths to navigate based on the current route:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const goBack = () => {
    // Navigate back to the previous route
    navigate(-1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={goBack}>Go Back</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
### Use <Link>:

When you need to navigate based on user interactions like clicking on a link.<br>
When the navigation can be expressed declaratively in your JSX.<br>
When you want to leverage accessibility and SEO benefits of anchor tags.<br>
### Use useNavigate:

When navigation needs to be triggered programmatically, such as after form submissions, API calls, or other side effects.<br>
When you need to navigate based on complex conditions or logic.<br>
When you want to pass state or perform relative navigation.
